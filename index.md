# Nikola Ajdukovic

Senior .NET / C# developer with over 12 years of professional experience.

I write **deep, practical technical articles** focused on understanding *why* things exist and *how* they work under the hood — not just how to use them.

My content is based on real production systems and long-lived codebases, with an emphasis on correctness, clarity, and intentional design.

## What I write about

- LINQ operators explained from first principles  
  *(Select, Where, SelectMany, OfType, Cast, ToXxx, AsXxx)*
- IEnumerable, `yield`, deferred execution, and streaming pipelines
- Real-world domain modeling  
  *(banking, logistics, sports betting)*
- Architecture and design decisions in .NET systems
- Performance, correctness, and maintainability

## About this site

This site serves as a **personal technical archive** and a clean reading hub for my C# / .NET work.

Medium remains the primary publishing platform; this site exists to keep everything:

- centralized  
- searchable  
- distraction-free  

No reposting, no duplicated content — just a single place to access everything I publish.
